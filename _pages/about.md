# About me

<p> I am passionate about STEM Education. I love teaching and helping students of all ages discover the beauty of science and make sense of the world around us. <br> Most of all I like to provide opportunities, make connections, facillitate collaborations in academic environments. <br>
I believe that all students should have access to high-quality education, and as an educator I would like to contribute to this direction. <br> </p>
<p> I am interested in Education Outreach, STEM program management, curriculum and program development. <br> </p>
<p> Research-wise I am interested in the cognitive mechanisms that promote STEM learning and the interaction between such cognitive processes and contextual and cross-cultural factors. </p>
